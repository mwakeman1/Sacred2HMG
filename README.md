Creates a heightmap from Sacred 2 .sector files. 

Usage: 

Extract the .sector files from the sector zips, place the script in the same folder as the extracted files, and run from the command prompt. 

Requirements:

Python and various dependencies (will be packaged later).

Bugs: 

No smoothing between the sectors, so it appears blocky.
